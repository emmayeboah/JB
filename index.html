        <p>For all the times that you rained on my parade</p>
        <p>And all the clubs you get in using my name</p>
        <p>You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake</p>
        <p>You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't</p>
        <p>And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care</p>
        <p>I don't but, you still hit my phone up</p>
        <p>And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'</p>
        <p>I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that</p>
        <p>My mama don't like you and she likes everyone</p>
        <p>And I never like to admit that I was wrong</p>
        <p>And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on</p>
        <p>But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own</p>
        <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much</p>
        <p>Oh baby, you should go and love yourself</p>
        <p>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'</p>
        <p>You should go and love yourself</p>
        <p>When you told me that you hated my friends</p>
        <p>The only problem was with you and not them</p>
        <p>And every time you told me my opinion was wrong</p>
        <p>And tried to make me forget where I came from</p>
        <p>And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care</p>
        <p>I don't but, you still hit my phone up</p>
        <p>And baby, I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'</p>
        <p>I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that</p>
        <p>My mama don't like you and she likes everyone</p>
        <p>And I never like to admit that I was wrong</p>
        <p>And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on</p>
        <p>But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own</p>
        <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much</p>
        <p>Oh baby, you should go and love yourself</p>
        <p>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'</p>
        <p>You should go and love yourself</p>
        <p>For all the times that you made me feel small</p>
        <p>I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all</p>
        <p>I never felt so low when I was vulnerable</p>
        <p>Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</p>
        <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much</p>
        <p>Oh baby, you should go and love yourself</p>
        <p>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'</p>
        <p>You should go and love yourself</p>
        <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much</p>
        <p>Oh baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)</p>
        <p>And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)</p>
        <p>Still holdin' on to somethin'</p>
        <p>You should go and love yourself</p>
